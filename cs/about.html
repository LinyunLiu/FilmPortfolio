            <h2>Who am I ? ✐</h2>
            <p class="about">I have just received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a Concentration
                in Media & Communication: Film Studies at Trinity Western University in Canada.
                <br><br>
                I love all fields of Computer Science and I have been motivated to try them all. As a huge nerd,
                I love to learn and making meaningful projects, it brings me tremendous joys to study and understand
                new things especially in the world of I.T.. I believe my greatest strength is determination of doing what
                I feel passionate about, such as software engineering, full stack developments, developing algorithms, etc.
                I have also been studying and practicing fine arts since kindergarten. With the artistic and emotional
                part of me, I cannot control myself to make websites and software as beautiful as possible.
                Problem Solving skill is what I often feel proud of, it is what I am particularly great at doing,
                I convince myself that there is always a solution to the problem, and I will be committed to fulfill
                that promise with my perfectionist mind, and I always did. And being a perfectionist, I have a habit to
                write code that is highly organized, and bugs free as possible as I can. I consider myself an author of a
                piece of code instead of a programmer.
                <br><br>
                I am in general very motivated to contribute to the world of technology with my skills, patience and
                creativity. I am always eager to find out what more I am capable of creating, innovating with the knowledge
                that I have been dedicating to learn. As a young individual, I also hope I can explore my potentials
                and possibilities to acquire more valuable experiences, to challenge myself, as well as making contributions
                to the growth of technologies.
